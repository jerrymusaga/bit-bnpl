# MoonPay Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated MoonPay onramp/offramp functionality into BitBNPL, allowing users to buy BTC with fiat and merchants to cash out earnings.

**Total Implementation Time**: ~3 hours
**Status**: ✅ Complete - All 6 phases implemented

---

## Phase 1: Configuration ✅

### Files Created:
- **`/frontend/config/moonpay.config.ts`**
  - MoonPay API configuration
  - URL builders for buy/sell widgets
  - Environment management (sandbox/production)
  - Webhook signature verification helpers

- **`/frontend/.env.local`** (updated)
  - Added MoonPay environment variables:
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOONPAY_API_KEY`
    - `MOONPAY_SECRET_KEY`
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOONPAY_ENV`
    - `MOONPAY_WEBHOOK_URL`

---

## Phase 2: Onramp Components ✅

### Files Created:
- **`/frontend/hooks/useMoonPay.ts`**
  - React hook for MoonPay widget management
  - `openBuyWidget()` - Opens buy BTC popup
  - `openSellWidget()` - Opens sell BTC popup
  - `closeWidget()` - Closes popup
  - Popup window lifecycle management
  - PostMessage event handling

- **`/frontend/components/onramp/BuyBTCButton.tsx`**
  - Reusable button to trigger BTC purchase
  - Multiple variants: primary, outline, ghost
  - Sizes: sm, md, lg
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Success callbacks

- **`/frontend/components/onramp/BuyBTCModal.tsx`**
  - Beautiful modal UI for insufficient balance scenarios
  - Shows current balance vs required amount
  - Displays shortfall calculation
  - Lists MoonPay benefits (fast, secure, auto-delivered)
  - Integrates with `useMoonPay` hook

- **`/frontend/components/onramp/SellBTCButton.tsx`**
  - Cash out button for merchants
  - Opens MoonPay sell widget
  - Green color scheme for cash out actions
  - Same variants and sizes as BuyBTCButton

- **`/frontend/components/onramp/index.ts`**
  - Central export file for all onramp components

---

## Phase 3: Checkout Error Message ✅

### File Modified:
- **`/frontend/app/checkout/page.tsx`**

### Changes:
1. **Updated insufficient funds UI** (line ~828):
   - Clear call-to-action: "Go to Dashboard to Add Funds"
   - Removed BuyBTC modal from checkout (wrong place in flow)
   - Educational content explaining BitBNPL flow:
     - Buy BTC and lock as collateral
     - Borrow MUSD against Bitcoin
     - Shop with MUSD while keeping BTC upside

### User Experience:
- When user can't afford checkout → Redirected to dashboard
- Dashboard is the proper place to manage funds
- Checkout remains focused on completing purchases, not solving funding

---

## Phase 4: Dashboard Integration ✅

### File Modified:
- **`/frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**

### Changes:
1. **Import BuyBTCButton**:
   ```typescript
   import { BuyBTCButton } from '@/components/onramp'
   ```

2. **Added to Quick Actions section** (line ~295):
   - Positioned between "Shop with BitBNPL" and "Add Bitcoin Collateral"
   - Primary variant with gradient orange styling
   - Full width button
   - Auto-refreshes on success

### User Experience:
- Dashboard → Quick Actions → "Buy BTC" button prominent
- One-click access to purchase BTC
- No need to leave dashboard to add funds

---

## Phase 5: Webhooks & Callbacks ✅

### Files Created:
- **`/frontend/app/api/webhooks/moonpay/route.ts`**
  - POST endpoint: `/api/webhooks/moonpay`
  - Verifies MoonPay webhook signatures using HMAC-SHA256
  - Handles 4 event types:
    - `transaction_created` - Initial transaction
    - `transaction_updated` - Status changes
    - `transaction_completed` - Successful purchase
    - `transaction_failed` - Failed purchase
  - Logs all events for debugging
  - TODO placeholders for database integration

- **`/frontend/hooks/useMoonPayNotifications.ts`**
  - Client-side notification hook
  - Listens for postMessage events from MoonPay popup
  - Triggers callbacks based on transaction status
  - Shows browser notifications on success/failure
  - Can be extended with toast notifications (react-hot-toast)

### Security:
- Webhook signature verification prevents spoofing
- Only accepts messages from moonpay.com domains
- Secret key stored server-side only

---

## Phase 6: Merchant Offramp ✅

### File Modified:
- **`/frontend/app/merchant/dashboard/page.tsx`**

### Changes:
1. **Import SellBTCButton**:
   ```typescript
   import { SellBTCButton } from '@/components/onramp'
   ```

2. **MUSD Balance Card** (line ~294):
   - Added small "Cash Out" button next to balance
   - Ghost variant for subtle integration
   - Merchant can click directly from balance card

3. **New Cash Out Section** (line ~529):
   - Prominent card in right column
   - Shows available MUSD balance
   - Large green "Cash Out" button
   - Lists 3 benefits:
     - Instant cash out to bank account
     - Secure via MoonPay
     - Competitive transparent fees

### User Experience:
- Merchant earns MUSD from sales
- Dashboard shows balance with "Cash Out" option
- Click → MoonPay sell widget opens
- Complete KYC → Receive fiat to bank account

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)

### 1. MoonPay Account Setup
- [ ] Create MoonPay account at https://www.moonpay.com/dashboard/getting-started
- [ ] Get API keys (sandbox for testing)
- [ ] Configure webhook URL in MoonPay dashboard
- [ ] Test in sandbox environment
- [ ] Apply for production access
- [ ] Update .env.local with real keys

### 2. Database Integration
The webhook handler has TODO placeholders for:
- [ ] Store transaction records in database
- [ ] Link transactions to user wallet addresses
- [ ] Track transaction status changes
- [ ] Send email notifications on success/failure
- [ ] Display transaction history in UI

### 3. Enhanced Notifications
- [ ] Install `react-hot-toast` or similar
- [ ] Replace console.log with actual toast notifications
- [ ] Show success message when BTC arrives
- [ ] Show progress during transaction
- [ ] Handle error states gracefully

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Test buy flow with sandbox API
- [ ] Test sell flow with sandbox API
- [ ] Verify webhook signature validation
- [ ] Test popup blocked scenarios
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Load test with multiple concurrent users

### 5. Production Hardening
- [ ] Rate limiting on webhook endpoint
- [ ] Proper error tracking (Sentry/LogRocket)
- [ ] Transaction reconciliation system
- [ ] Customer support integration
- [ ] Compliance documentation (KYC/AML)

## Cost Analysis

### MoonPay Fees:
- **Buy BTC**: 1-4.5% fee (varies by payment method)
- **Sell BTC**: 1-4.5% fee (varies by cash out method)

### Example Transaction:
- User buys $100 BTC → MoonPay fee ~$4 → User receives ~$96 worth of BTC
- Merchant sells $500 MUSD → MoonPay fee ~$20 → Merchant receives ~$480 fiat

## Success Metrics

### User Onramp:
- % of users who complete checkout after seeing "Buy BTC" modal
- Average time from "Buy BTC" click to checkout completion
- Drop-off rate in MoonPay flow

### Merchant Offramp:
- % of merchants who use cash out feature
- Average cash out frequency
- Average cash out amount
- Merchant satisfaction with payout speed
