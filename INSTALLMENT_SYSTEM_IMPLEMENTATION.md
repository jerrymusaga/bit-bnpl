# BitBNPL Installment System Implementation

## Overview
Complete Buy Now, Pay Later system with bi-weekly installments, preserving user's Bitcoin while enabling flexible payments.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Smart Contract (`InstallmentProcessor.sol`)
Location: `/contracts/src/InstallmentProcessor.sol`

**Features:**
- Bi-weekly payment intervals (not monthly!)
- Liquidity pool management for instant merchant payments
- Interest rates:
  - Pay in full: 0%
  - 4 payments (8 weeks): 0.5%
  - 6 payments (12 weeks): 1.0%
  - 8 payments (16 weeks): 1.5%
- Late fee system: 1% after 1-week grace period
- Collateral locking mechanism
- Payment tracking and history

**Key Functions:**
```solidity
createPurchase()    // Platform pays merchant, creates installment plan
makePayment()       // User makes bi-weekly payment
getUserActivePurchases() // Get all active installment purchases
getTotalOwed()      // Calculate total remaining debt
```

### 2. New Checkout Page
Location: `/frontend/app/checkout/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Real-time borrowing capacity check from Mezo
- 4 payment plan options (1, 4, 6, 8 payments)
- Value proposition highlights:
  - Preserved borrowing capacity display
  - Comparison: installments vs pay-in-full
  - "Keep Your Bitcoin" messaging
  - Low interest rate emphasis
- Beautiful UI with plan selection
- Capacity warnings if insufficient collateral
- Success page with payment schedule

**Key Improvements:**
```typescript
// Shows how much capacity is preserved
preservedCapacity = totalAmount - perPaymentAmount

// Example: $1,199 iPhone with 4 payments
// Pay in full: Borrow $1,199 immediately
// 4 payments: Borrow only $301 initially
// Preserved: $898 available for other purchases!
```

### 3. Dashboard Fixes
Location: `/frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Fixed Issues:**
- ‚úÖ Swapped collateral/debt values (were backwards)
- ‚úÖ Added real accrued interest from Mezo contract
- ‚úÖ Fixed hardcoded "Member Since" date
- ‚úÖ Using real BTC price from oracle

### 4. Mezo Contract Integration
Location: `/frontend/hooks/useMezoContracts.ts`

**Added:**
- `accruedInterest` - Real interest from Mezo (not mock)
- `minNetDebt` - Minimum borrowing amount from protocol
- Fixed trove data parsing (indices were swapped)

## üéØ Core Value Proposition

### Problem We Solve:
**Users want to buy things WITHOUT:**
1. Selling their Bitcoin (lose upside potential)
2. Locking up all borrowing capacity at once
3. Paying high interest rates (20%+ credit cards)

### How BitBNPL Works:

```
Traditional Way (Bad):
‚îî‚îÄ User borrows $1,199 from Mezo TODAY
‚îî‚îÄ Interest accrues on full $1,199 immediately
‚îî‚îÄ Borrowing capacity locked
‚îî‚îÄ Risk: If BTC drops, large debt to manage

BitBNPL Way (Good):
‚îî‚îÄ Platform pays merchant $1,199 from liquidity pool
‚îî‚îÄ User borrows $0 from Mezo initially
‚îî‚îÄ Every 2 weeks: User borrows only $301 (what they need)
‚îî‚îÄ Benefits:
   ‚îú‚îÄ Preserved $898 capacity for opportunities
   ‚îú‚îÄ Lower interest (only on borrowed amount)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Safer liquidation risk (smaller Mezo debt)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Dollar-cost average the debt
```

## üìä Payment Plan Comparison

| Plan | Payments | Interval | Interest | Total Cost | Preserved Capacity |
|------|----------|----------|----------|------------|--------------------|
| Pay in Full | 1 | Now | 0% | $1,199 | $0 |
| 4 Payments | 4 | 2 weeks | 0.5% | $1,205 | ~$898 |
| 6 Payments | 6 | 2 weeks | 1.0% | $1,211 | ~$999 |
| 8 Payments | 8 | 2 weeks | 1.5% | $1,217 | ~$1,049 |

## üöß Next Steps (To Implement)

### 1. Deploy Smart Contract
```bash
cd contracts
forge build
forge create --rpc-url https://rpc.test.mezo.org \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  src/InstallmentProcessor.sol:InstallmentProcessor \
  --constructor-args <MUSD_ADDRESS>
```

### 2. Create Contract Hook ‚úÖ COMPLETED
File: `/frontend/hooks/useInstallmentProcessor.ts`

**Implemented Features:**
- `createPurchase()` - Create new installment purchase
- `makePayment()` - Make bi-weekly payment
- `getPurchase()` - Get purchase details
- `isPaymentLate()` - Check if payment is late
- `getUserActivePurchases()` - Get all active purchases
- Transaction state tracking (isCreating, isConfirming, isConfirmed)
- Error handling with createError and paymentError

### 3. Add Payment Tracking to Dashboard
Add new section to dashboard showing:

```typescript
// Active Installment Purchases
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ üì± iPhone 15 Pro                            ‚îÇ
‚îÇ Next Payment: $301.25 due in 8 days        ‚îÇ
‚îÇ Progress: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 2/4 payments             ‚îÇ
‚îÇ [Make Payment]                              ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### 4. Payment Reminder System
Create component: `/frontend/components/PaymentReminder.tsx`

Features:
- Check for payments due in next 3 days
- Show banner at top of dashboard
- "Pay Now" quick action button
- Late payment warnings

### 5. Integrate Checkout with Real Contract ‚úÖ COMPLETED
File: `/frontend/app/checkout/page.tsx`

**Implemented Features:**
- Uses `useInstallmentProcessor` hook for contract integration
- Calls `createPurchase()` with merchant address, amount, installments, and capacity
- Real-time transaction state tracking (Creating ‚Üí Confirming ‚Üí Confirmed)
- Auto-redirect to success page on confirmation
- Error display for failed transactions
- Button state management (disabled during transactions)

**Flow:**
1. User selects payment plan (1, 4, 6, or 8 payments)
2. Clicks "Complete Purchase" button
3. `createPurchase()` is called with real contract parameters
4. Button shows "Creating Purchase..." then "Confirming Transaction..."
5. Once confirmed, success page displays with payment schedule
6. Any errors are displayed inline with helpful messages

## üí° Key Technical Decisions

### Why Bi-Weekly Instead of Monthly?
- ‚úÖ Not tied to calendar months
- ‚úÖ More manageable smaller payments
- ‚úÖ Matches common paycheck cycles
- ‚úÖ Easier to implement (timestamp-based)
- ‚úÖ Better cash flow for users

### Why Platform Liquidity Pool?
- ‚úÖ Merchants get paid instantly (good UX)
- ‚úÖ Users don't need full capacity upfront
- ‚úÖ Platform earns interest spread
- ‚úÖ More capital efficient for users

### Collateral Requirements
```
User's BTC Value >= Purchase Amount
```
This is fundamental - users need sufficient collateral, BUT:
- They DON'T spend their BTC
- They preserve it for price appreciation
- They only borrow what they need, when they need it

## üìù Environment Variables Needed

Add to `/frontend/.env.local`:
```bash
# InstallmentProcessor Contract (after deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTALLMENT_PROCESSOR_ADDRESS=0x...

# Gelato Relay (for Unisat wallet support)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GELATO_RELAY_API_KEY=your_gelato_key_here
```

## üé® UI/UX Highlights

### Checkout Page:
1. **Capacity Display** - Shows available borrowing power
2. **Preserved Capacity** - Highlights how much capacity installments save
3. **Value Props** - "Keep Your Bitcoin", "Low Interest", "Flexible Payments"
4. **Plan Comparison** - Easy to compare all 4 payment options
5. **Smart Warnings** - Alerts if insufficient capacity

### Success Page:
1. **Confirmation** - Clear success message
2. **Schedule** - Shows payment amount and frequency
3. **Value Reminder** - Emphasizes preserved capacity benefit
4. **Next Steps** - Links to dashboard and continue shopping

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **Collateral Locking** - User's BTC is locked proportionally to prevent withdrawal during installments
2. **Late Fees** - 1 week grace period, then 1% penalty
3. **Liquidation Risk** - If user misses 2+ payments, BTC can be liquidated
4. **Platform Risk** - Platform bears default risk but protected by user's collateral

## üìä Revenue Model

### Platform Revenue Streams:
1. **Interest Spread** - User pays 0.5-1.5%, Mezo charges 1%, platform keeps difference
2. **Merchant Fees** - Charge merchants 2-3% for instant settlement
3. **Late Fees** - 1% of payment amount after grace period

### Example Revenue (per $1,000 purchase):
```
4-payment plan @ 0.5% interest = $5 user pays
Mezo cost @ 1% APR = ~$0.80
Platform profit = $4.20

Merchant fee @ 2.5% = $25
Total platform revenue = $29.20 per transaction
```
