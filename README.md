# BitBNPL - Bitcoin Payment Infrastructure & BNPL Platform

**Digital payments with Bitcoin, without selling it.**

BitBNPL is a **payment infrastructure** that enables seamless digital payments using Bitcoin through MUSD stablecoin. More than just a Buy Now Pay Later platform, BitBNPL solves the fundamental problem of using Bitcoin for everyday purchases: Bitcoin holders can shop anywhere without selling their BTC.

**How it works:** Customers lock Bitcoin as collateral, borrow MUSD stablecoin against it, and make instant digital payments. Merchants receive immediate settlements in MUSD. Customers maintain full exposure to Bitcoin price appreciation while enjoying flexible payment options.

Built on **Mezo blockchain** with integrated **MoonPay** fiat onramp, **Mezo Passport** wallet infrastructure, and a comprehensive **collateral lending protocol** - BitBNPL provides the complete payment infrastructure: from fiat to Bitcoin, Bitcoin to MUSD, and MUSD to merchants. All while your Bitcoin remains securely locked as collateral, not sold.

## Overview

### The Problem We Solve

**Bitcoin as a payment method is broken.** Bitcoin holders face a dilemma:

**Using Bitcoin for payments today means:**
- Selling BTC and missing potential price appreciation
- Triggering taxable events on every purchase
- Reducing your long-term Bitcoin position
- Volatility makes pricing difficult for merchants
- Slow settlement times (blockchain confirmations)

**Existing solutions fall short:**
- Traditional payment processors don&apos;t support Bitcoin
- Crypto payment gateways force users to spend appreciating assets
- BNPL platforms don&apos;t work with cryptocurrency
- Bitcoin Lightning has liquidity and adoption challenges

### How It Works: Payment Infrastructure Flow

**BitBNPL provides complete payment rails from BTC to merchants:**

**Payment Flow 1: Direct MUSD Payment**
```
Customer has MUSD → Select Items → Choose Payment Plan → Pay with MUSD
→ Merchant receives instant settlement → Done
```

**Payment Flow 2: Bitcoin Collateral Payment**
```
Customer has BTC → Checkout detects low MUSD → Navigate to Dashboard
→ Lock BTC as Collateral → Borrow MUSD (90% LTV, 1% APR)
→ Return to Checkout → Pay with MUSD → Merchant receives settlement
→ Customer repays MUSD loan anytime → BTC unlocked
```

**Payment Flow 3: Fiat Onramp to Bitcoin Payment**
```
Customer has Fiat → Dashboard "Buy BTC" → MoonPay Widget Opens
→ Buy BTC with Credit Card/Bank → BTC arrives in Mezo wallet
→ Lock BTC as Collateral → Borrow MUSD → Pay merchant with MUSD
→ Merchant receives instant settlement → Customer repays flexibly
```

**The Infrastructure Result:**
- **Customers**: Pay with Bitcoin without selling it - maintain BTC exposure while transacting
- **Merchants**: Receive stable, instant MUSD settlements - no BTC volatility risk
- **Bitcoin Ecosystem**: Bridge BTC holders to e-commerce without forcing them to sell
- **Payment Network**: Complete rails from fiat → BTC → MUSD → merchants → repayment

#### Contract Interaction Hooks

All hooks include fallback addresses for Mezo contracts:

| Hook File | Contract | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `/frontend/hooks/useMerchantRegistry.ts` | MerchantRegistry | Merchant registration, verification checks on Mezo |
| `/frontend/hooks/useInstallmentProcessor.ts` | InstallmentProcessor | Payment initiation, installment tracking on Mezo |
| `/frontend/hooks/useAdminData.ts` | Both contracts | Admin dashboard data from Mezo chain |

**Example** (`useMerchantRegistry.ts`):
```typescript
const MERCHANT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS =
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MERCHANT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS ||
  '0xC80a70e2C2a8d3534043F200C83D772943AF0D91'

// Uses Wagmi to read from Mezo blockchain
const { data: isMerchant } = useReadContract({
  address: MERCHANT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS,
  abi: merchantRegistryAbi,
  functionName: 'isMerchant',
  args: [address],
})
```

#### Pages with Mezo Integration

| Page | File | Mezo Integration |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Dashboard** | `/frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx` | **Core customer flow**: BTC collateral management, MUSD borrowing against BTC, loan repayment, health factor monitoring |
| Admin Dashboard | `/frontend/app/admin/page.tsx` | Reads merchant/payment data from Mezo contracts, manages liquidity pool |
| Merchant Registration | `/frontend/app/merchant/register/page.tsx` | Registers merchant address on Mezo blockchain |
| Merchant Dashboard | `/frontend/app/merchant/dashboard/page.tsx` | Displays transaction history from Mezo, integration code |
| **Checkout** | `/frontend/app/checkout/page.tsx` | **Checks MUSD balance**, initiates payments, redirects to dashboard if insufficient funds |
| Marketplace | `/frontend/app/marketplace/page.tsx` | Lists verified merchants from Mezo MerchantRegistry |

**Customer Dashboard (`/dashboard`) - The MUSD Acquisition Hub**:

This is where the magic happens. When customers don&apos;t have MUSD to shop:

1. **Add BTC Collateral** (`AddCollateralModal`):
   - Locks Bitcoin in Mezo contract as collateral
   - Enables borrowing capacity calculation based on BTC price oracle

2. **Borrow MUSD** (`BorrowMUSDModal`):
   - Borrows MUSD against locked BTC (up to ~90% LTV)
   - 1% APR interest rate
   - No need to sell Bitcoin
   - Maintains BTC price exposure

3. **Repay MUSD** (`RepayMUSDModal`):
   - Repay borrowed MUSD at any time
   - Improves health factor
   - Can withdraw BTC after full repayment

4. **Buy BTC** (`BuyBTCButton` - MoonPay integration):
   - If user has no BTC, opens MoonPay widget
   - Purchase BTC with fiat (credit card, bank transfer)
   - BTC sent directly to Mezo wallet

5. **Monitor Health**:
   - Real-time collateralization ratio
   - Liquidation price warnings
   - Health factor tracking

#### Components with Mezo Integration

| Component | File | Mezo Integration |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| Navbar | `/frontend/components/Navbar.tsx` | OrangeKit wallet connection for Mezo |

  data-bitbnpl-merchant="0x742d35Cc..."
  data-bitbnpl-amount="1000"
  data-bitbnpl-order-id="ORDER123">
  Pay with BitBNPL
</button>
```

Clicking the button navigates to the checkout page that connects to Mezo and initiates payment.

---

### 4. React SDK (`/packages/react-sdk`)

**Location**: `/packages/react-sdk/src/`

NPM package for React applications to integrate Mezo BNPL payments.

**Published**: `@bitbnpl/react-sdk` on NPM

**Mezo Integration**:
```typescript
// src/BitBNPLButton.tsx
// Configures Wagmi with Mezo Matsnet
const config = createConfig({
  chains: [mezoMatsnet],  // Chain ID 31611
  transports: {
    [mezoMatsnet.id]: http('https://rpc.test.mezo.org'),
  },
})
```

**Usage**:
```typescript
import { BitBNPLButton } from '@bitbnpl/react-sdk';

<BitBNPLButton
  merchantAddress="0x742d35Cc..."
  amount="1000"
  orderId="ORDER123"
/>
```

The button handles Mezo wallet connection and payment initiation.

---

### 5. MoonPay Integration (`/frontend/components/onramp`)

**Location**: `/frontend/components/onramp/BuyBTCButton.tsx`

MoonPay enables users to purchase Bitcoin with fiat currency, solving the cold start problem for users without BTC.

**Integration Code**:
```typescript
import { useMoonPay } from '@/hooks/useMoonPay'

export function BuyBTCButton() {
  const { openBuyWidget, isConnected } = useMoonPay()

  const handleClick = () => {
    openBuyWidget({
      baseCurrencyCode: 'usd',
      onSuccess: (transactionId) => {
        // BTC sent to user's Mezo wallet
        window.location.reload()
      }
    })
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Buy BTC</button>
}
```

**How It Works**:
1. User clicks "Buy BTC" button in `/dashboard`
2. MoonPay widget opens (embedded in app or popup)
3. User selects payment method (credit card, bank transfer, Apple Pay, etc.)
4. MoonPay processes fiat payment and purchases BTC
5. BTC is sent directly to user&apos;s connected Mezo wallet address
6. User can immediately use BTC as collateral to borrow MUSD

**Benefits**:
- No need to leave the app
- Direct BTC delivery to Mezo wallet
- Supports 100+ countries
- Multiple payment methods
- KYC handled by MoonPay

**Configuration**:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOONPAY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

## Architecture

### Payment Flow on Mezo

#### 1. Merchant Registration
   - Merchant wallet address registers on Mezo via `MerchantRegistry.registerMerchant()`
   - Admin verifies merchant: `MerchantRegistry.verifyMerchant(address)`

#### 2. Customer Checkout & MUSD Acquisition Flow

When a customer clicks "Pay with BitBNPL", they are directed to `/checkout` which intelligently handles three scenarios:

**Scenario A: Customer has sufficient MUSD balance**
   - Customer selects installment plan (1, 4, 6, or 8 payments)
   - Initiates payment: `InstallmentProcessor.initiatePayment(merchantAddress, totalAmount, installments)`
   - Customer approves MUSD token spending on Mezo
   - First installment + interest paid immediately

**Scenario B: Customer has BTC but no MUSD**
   - Checkout detects insufficient MUSD balance
   - Customer is prompted: "Go to Dashboard to Add Funds"
   - User navigates to `/dashboard` where they can:
     1. **Add BTC as Collateral**: Lock Bitcoin in Mezo smart contract
     2. **Borrow MUSD**: Borrow MUSD against BTC collateral (up to ~90% LTV at 1% APR)
     3. **Shop with MUSD**: Use borrowed MUSD for purchases while keeping BTC upside
   - After borrowing MUSD, customer returns to checkout to complete purchase

**Scenario C: Customer has no BTC**
   - Dashboard shows "Buy BTC" button (MoonPay integration)
   - Customer clicks "Buy BTC" → MoonPay widget opens
   - Customer purchases Bitcoin with fiat (credit card, bank transfer, etc.)
   - BTC is sent directly to customer&apos;s Mezo wallet
   - Customer then follows Scenario B flow (add collateral → borrow MUSD → shop)

**Key Insight**: Customers **never need to sell their Bitcoin** to shop. They borrow MUSD against BTC, make purchases, and can repay the MUSD loan anytime to unlock their Bitcoin.

#### 3. Instant Merchant Settlement
   - Full payment amount transferred from liquidity pool to merchant on Mezo
   - Platform fee (1%) deducted and sent to admin
   - Merchant receives funds immediately, regardless of customer&apos;s installment plan

#### 4. Installment Payments & Loan Management
   - Customer pays remaining installments on schedule
   - `InstallmentProcessor.payInstallment(paymentId)` called per payment
   - Late payments tracked on-chain
   - Customer can repay MUSD loan anytime via `/dashboard`
   - Upon full MUSD repayment, customer can withdraw BTC collateral
